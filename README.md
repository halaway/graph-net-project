# graph-net-project

ðŸš€ This project examines graph-based data storage for managing and connecting nodes from 
components such as _Compounds_, _Diseases_, _Genes_, and _Anatomies_.

## Files
- The _"nodes_test.tsv"_ contains over 20,000 nodes pertaining to these four element types with
  each unique attribute such as _ID_, _Name_, and _Kind_.

| ID                     | Name            | Kind      |
| ---------------------- |:---------------:| ---------:|
|Anatomy::UBERON:0000042 | serous membrane | Anatomy   |
| Compound::DB00396      | Progesterone    | Compound  |

- The _"edges_test.tsv_" file contains over 1M edge relationships between a target and source node
  with individually labeled relationship types referred to by the "_metaedges.tsv_" file.

|  Metaedge | abbreviation |	edges	| source_nodes |	target_nodes	|unbiased |
| --------  |:------------ :| ---------|:-------- :|---------------:| ---------:|
Anatomy - downregulates - Gene	AdG	102240	36	15097	102240
Anatomy - expresses - Gene	AeG	526407	241	18094	453477
Anatomy - upregulates - Gene	AuG	97848	36	15929	97848

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

This file contains all the necessary queries needed for running this program.

- Each Query Solves a specific portion of the project using Neo4J as a graph based NoSQL Store.

To execute a query from the terminal:
    - run: python3 projectBD.py <"QUERY SELECTED">

# NOTE
- Files Can be hosted on a local Python server using:
    python3 -m http.server
- When creating a database, the data should only be loaded once for both Nodes and Edges.
