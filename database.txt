Build a database system to mode] HetioNet
• The database should at least answer the following questions in 
the quickest response time
1. Given a disease id, what is its name, what are drug names 
that can treat or palliate this disease, what are gene names that 
cause this disease, and where this disease occurs?
Obtain and output this information in a single query.
2. We assume that a compound can treat a disease if the compound 
up-regulates/down-regulates a gene, but the location 
down-regulates/up-regulates the gene in an opposite direction
where the disease occurs. Find all compounds that can treat a 
new disease (i.e. the missing edges between compound and disease excluding existing drugs): Obtain and output all drugs in a single query.
